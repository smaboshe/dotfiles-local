# dotfiles-local

[Local customisations](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles#make-your-own-customizations) I use with [dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).

## Usage

You probably shouldn't use this repo and create your own instead ... but if you insist, [install dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) first and then install this repo in your `$HOME` (`~`) directory.
